              5.What are your rights and how can you exercise them?
            </h3>
            <p>
              In connection with the processing of personal data, including
              cookies, you have the following rights: * Right of access to
              personal data You can ask us at any time to send you a
              confirmation as to whether or not your personal data are being
              processed. If we process your data, we will provide you with
              further details on the processing. If you request it, we will also
              provide you with a copy of the personal data processed. Please
              note that the first copy is free of charge, but any following copy
              will be provided for a small fee. * Right to rectification of
              personal data If we process your personal data inaccurately, you
              can notify us of this fact, and we will rectify the inaccurate
              personal data without undue delay. If you register on the Website,
              you will be able to rectify and amend your personal data yourself
              by editing your user account. * Right to erasure of personal data
              (“right to be forgotten”) You have the right to obtain from us the
              erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay in the
              following cases: * If the data are no longer necessary in relation
              to the purposes for which we have collected or otherwise processed
              them; * If you withdraw your consent to their processing and, at
              the same time, there will be no other legal ground for their
              processing (this only applies in the cases where we process
              personal data on the basis of your consent); * If you object and
              there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or
              if you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes; or
              * If your personal data are processed unlawfully. We will not be
              able to act on the request for the erasure of personal data if
              their processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom
              of expression and information, for compliance with any of our
              legal obligations, for the performance of a task carried out in
              the public interest, for the establishment, exercise, or defence
              of our legal claims, or for other reasons provided for by law. *
              Right to restriction of processing In cases stated in article 18
              of the GDRP, you have the right to obtain from us restriction of
              processing of your personal data for a certain period. * Right to
              data portability and to the provision of data in a
              machine-readable format In the case of automated processing based
              on your consent or performance of the contract, you have the right
              to receive the data in a structured, commonly used and
              machine-readable format and to have them transmitted by us to
              another personal data controller. * Right to object If we process
              personal data on the basis of our legitimate interest, you have
              the right to object to such processing. If you file such an
              objection, we will not be able to process your personal data
              unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
              processing, which override your interests or rights and freedoms,
              or for the establishment, exercise or defence of our legal claims.
              In case we process your personal data for marketing purposes about
              our products and services, we will terminate the processing
              without undue delay upon receipt of the objection. In such a case,
              we will no longer be able to send you offers of our products and
              services. * Right to withdraw consent If processing is based on
              your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any
              time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of
              processing based on the consent given before its withdrawal. *
              Right not to be the subject of automated decision-making Except
              where processing is necessary for entering into, or performance
              of, a contract, where this is permitted by applicable law, or
              based on your express consent, you have the right not to be the
              subject of any decision which is based solely on automated
              processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects
              concerning you or similarly affects you to a significant extent.
