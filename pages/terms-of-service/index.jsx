                warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied,

                affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service
                providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or
                any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or
                consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation
                lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data,
                replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in
                contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or
                otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any
                products procured using the service, or for any other claim
                related in any way to your use of the service or any product,
                including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any
                content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result
                of the use of the service or any content (or product) posted,
                transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even
                if advised of their possibility. Because some states or
                jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of
                liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such
                states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the
                maximum extent permitted by law.

              <p>
                The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to
                the termination date shall survive the termination of this
                agreement for all purposes. These Terms of Service are effective
                unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may
                terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us
                that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease
                using our site. If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect
                that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of
                these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at
                any time without notice and you will remain liable for all
                amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or
                accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part
                thereof).

              <p>
                Once you dispute an order payment it has an adverse impact on
                the company, financially, and causes a damage to our company
                profile in the eyes of the Payment Gateway. Hence, according to
                our policy, we will be banning accounts (directly involved in
                the dispute/against the same order number) of traders who
                dispute their payments and moving forward we will not entertain
                any requests to unban the accounts(s). The user who is involved
                in a disputed transaction in the normal course of the business,
                where there has not been any problem on our side, such users
                wont be eligible for any futher accounts with Nextlevelfunding
                and all their other active accounts, with current balance over
                and above the initial balance, will be refunded as well. This
                policy is in place to protect Nextlevelfunding from any
                financial adversity as well as to ensure the long term viability
                of the brand name.
